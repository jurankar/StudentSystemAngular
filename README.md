# How to use website
To add a course to database fill the form under "Add course to database".

Under paragraph "You can list all avalible classes or all classes that you are enrolled in", you can click either click on button "Show all courses",
which will show all courses from the database, or you can click on "Show enrolled courses", which will show you the courses that you are enrolled in.
P.S. When first launching the backend(springboot) of application, the database will be empty so you will have to add some courses and than click "Show all courses" to see results.

Under paragraph "Search for specific class by name.", you cann fill the input field with the name of the class you wish to find and click "Search course" to show it.

Under paragraph "Show the courses you are looking for", the courses that you are looking for will be displayed.
